# SQL Data Warehouse Project

Building a modern data warehouse using **Microsoft SQL Server**, based on a multi-layered **bronze-silver-gold architecture**. The project includes the full **ETL process**, **data modeling**, and **analytics** implementation using **T-SQL**.

## Architecture

- **Bronze layer**: Raw data ingestion from source systems.
- **Silver layer**: Data cleansing, transformation, and normalization.
- **Gold layer**: Curated, business-ready data models for reporting and analytics.

All processes and transformations were implemented in Transact-SQL (T-SQL) within Microsoft SQL Server.
